    "The stiffness matrix is a fundamental ingredient of the finite element method applied to the solution of boundary value problems in the theory of elasticity. It relates the nodal forces to the nodal displacements for individual elements and subsequently for the complete assemblage of elements. Its correct evaluation is of paramount importance as it is used to formulate equilibrium relations in the specific problem allowing the conversion of a continous problem into a discrete reperesentation. The computation of the stiffness matrix must be efficient and correct and must be able to handle a viriety of geometrical and physical aspects of the used finite elements. In this activity the student uses elements of interpolation theory, numerical integration and some basic aspects of theory of elasticity to compute and study the stiffness matrix in bi-lineal elements under plane strain assumptions. **After completing this notebook you should be able to:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identify the mathematical aspects involved in the formulation of stiffness matrices in the displacement-based finite element method applied to the theory of elasticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Implement efficient algorithms for the computation of the stiffness matrix in two-dimensional elements under plane strain.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identify relationships between the fundamental elements of the stiffness matrix and the element geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Recognize the relationship between some physical components of the theory of elasticty and its discrete version in terms of the stiffness matrix."

A **notebook** with redundant and unncecessary information is equivalent to a **notebook** with incomplete information.\n",

To achieve this identify which tasks are general and which ones are particular to the element and code them as independent subroutines. For instance, the computation of a Jacobian tensor is a general process and it must work independently from the specific element being solved.\n",
